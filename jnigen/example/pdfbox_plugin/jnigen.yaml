## Output configuration
output:
  c:
    ## Path to write generated C bindings
    path: 'src/'
    ## C files can be stored in a different sub-directory inside root.
    ##
    ## We have a guideline to keep all generated code in third_party/ since original
    ## project's license applies to generated code. So we specify third_party/ as
    ## c_subdir while keeping generated CMakeLists.txt in src/.
    subdir: 'third_party/'
    ## Name of the generated library. This is a required parameter, and used for the name of the
    ## shared library and CMake configuration.
    library_name: 'pdfbox_plugin'
  dart:
    ## Generated dart bindings will be written to this path. They will follow the same folder hierarchy
    ## as the original Java code.
    path: 'lib/src/third_party/'

## Classes / packages for which bindings need to be generated.
classes:
  - 'org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument'
  - 'org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocumentInformation'
  - 'org.apache.pdfbox.text.PDFTextStripper'

## Exclude a problematic static field. Static fields are usually converted directly to dart static fields. In the current implementation some string escaping problems may occur.
## See issue #31 (https://github.com/dart-lang/jnigen/issues/31) for more details.
## (This field does not appear in bindings unless full package bindings are generated using a `-Dclasses` override.)
## TODO(#31): For string fields, it may be better to generate a field getter than a direct literal.
exclude:
  fields:
    - 'org.apache.pdfbox.contentstream.operator.OperatorName#SHOW_TEXT_LINE_AND_SPACE'

## Dependencies to be downloaded using Maven (Invokes `mvn` command). These
## dependencies are always downloaded along with their transitive dependencies.
##
## Dependencies should be specified using groupID:artifactID:version format
## The downloaded dependencies are automatically added to classpath of the
## Java API scanning process. There's no need to specify these again in
## sourcepath and classpath.
##
## Note that when maven based tooling is used, the first run often has to fetch
## all the dependencies and might take some time. However, maven caches the
## artifacts in local repository, thus subsequent runs will be faster.
maven_downloads:
  ## For these dependencies, both source and JARs are downloaded.
  source_deps:
    - 'org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:2.0.26'
  ## Runtime dependencies for which bindings aren't generated directly.
  ## Only JARs are downloaded.
  jar_only_deps:
    - 'org.bouncycastle:bcmail-jdk15on:1.70'
    - 'org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.70'
