/// Package jni provides dart bindings for the Java Native Interface (JNI) on
/// Android and desktop platforms.
///
/// It's intended as a supplement to the (planned) jnigen tool, a Java wrapper
/// generator using JNI. The goal is to provide sufficiently complete
/// and ergonomic access to underlying JNI APIs.
///
/// Therefore, some understanding of JNI is required to use this module.
///
/// __Java VM:__
/// On Android, the existing JVM is used, a new JVM needs to be spawned on
/// flutter desktop & standalone targets.
///
/// ```dart
/// if (!Platform.isAndroid) {
///   // Spin up a JVM instance with custom classpath etc..
///   Jni.spawn(/* options */);
/// }
/// Jni jni = Jni.getInstance();
/// ```
///
/// __Dart standalone support:__
/// On dart standalone target, we unfortunately have no mechanism to bundle
/// the wrapper libraries with the executable. Thus it needs to be explicitly
/// placed in a accessible directory and provided as an argument to Jni.spawn.
///
/// This module depends on a shared library written in C, when using dart
/// standalone, it's your responsibility to:
///
///  * Build the library `libdartjni.so` in src/ directory of this plugin
///  * Bundle it appropriately with dart application
///  * Pass the path to library as a parameter to `Jni.spawn()`
///
/// __JNIEnv:__
/// The types `JNIEnv` and `JavaVM` in JNI are available as `JniEnv` and
/// `JavaVM` respectively, with extension methods to conveniently invoke the
/// function pointer members. Therefore the calling syntax will be similar to
/// JNI in C++. The first `JniEnv *` parameter is implicit.
///
/// __Debugging__:
/// Debugging JNI errors hard in general.
///
/// * On desktop platforms you can use JniEnv.ExceptionDescribe to print any
/// pending exception to stdout.
/// * On Android, things are slightly easier since CheckJNI is usually enabled
/// in debug builds.
/// * If you are not getting clear stack traces on JNI errors, check the
/// Android NDK page on how to enable CheckJNI using ADB.
/// * As a rule of thumb, when there's a NoClassDefFound / NoMethodFound error,
/// first check your class and method signatures for typos.
///

/// This library exports the minimum foundations of JNI.
///
/// For a higher level API, import jni_object.dart.
