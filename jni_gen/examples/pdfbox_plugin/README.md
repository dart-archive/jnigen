# pdfbox_plugin

Example of a JNI plugin using `jni_gen` to auto-generate bindings for PDFBox java library.

Bindings can be generated by running `dart run jni_gen --config jnigen.yaml`. Required source code and JARs will be downloaded using maven (requires `mvn` command).

`jni_gen` is also available as an API which tooling scripts can use. See `tool/generate_bindings.dart` for the script equivalent of the YAML file.
