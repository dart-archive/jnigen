## Root for generated C bindings.
c_root: 'src/'

## C files can be stored in a different sub-directory inside c_root.
##
## We have a guideline to keep all generated code in third_party/ since original
## project's license applies to generated code. So we specify third_party/ as
## c_subdir while keeping generated CMakeLists.txt in src/.
c_subdir: 'third_party/'

## Root for generated Dart bindings.
dart_root: 'lib/third_party/'

## Classes / packages for which bindings need to be generated.
classes:
  - 'org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel'
  - 'org.apache.pdfbox.text'

## Dependencies to be downloaded using Maven (Invokes `mvn` command). These
## dependencies are always downloaded along with their transitive dependencies.
##
## Dependencies should be specified using groupID:artifactID:version format
## The downloaded dependencies are automatically added to classpath of the
## Java API scanning process. There's no need to specify these again in
## sourcepath and classpath.
##
## Note that when maven based tooling is used, the first run often has to fetch
## all the dependencies and might take some time. However, maven caches most
## artifacts in local repository, thus subsequent runs will be faster.
maven_downloads:
  ## For these dependencies, both source and JARs are downloaded.
  source_deps:
    - 'org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:2.0.26'
  ## Runtime dependencies for which bindings aren't generated directly.
  ## Only JARs are downloaded.
  jar_only_deps:
    - 'org.bouncycastle:bcmail-jdk15on:1.70'
    - 'org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.70'
