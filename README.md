## jnigen

This project intends to provide 2 packages to enable JNI interop from Dart & Flutter. Currently this package is highly experimental.

| Package | Description |
| ------- | --------- |
| [jni](jni/) | Ergonomic C bindings to JNI C API and several helper methods |
| [jnigen](jnigen/) | Tool to generate Dart bindings to Java code using FFI |

This project is a work-in-progress and highly experimental. Users can check out and experiment with the examples. We do not guarantee stability of the API or commands at this point.

## SDK Requirements
Dart standalone target is supported, but due to some problems with pubspec, the `dart` command must be from Flutter SDK and not Dart SDK. See [dart-lang/pub#3563](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/issues/3563).

Along with JDK, maven (`mvn` command) is required. On Windows, it can be installed using a package manager such as `scoop`.

On windows, you need to append the path of `jvm.dll` in your JDK installation to PATH.

For example, on Powershell:

```powershell
$env:Path += ";${env:JAVA_HOME}\bin\server".
```

(If JAVA_HOME not set, find the `java.exe` executable and set the environment variable in Control Panel).
